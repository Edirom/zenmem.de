    home_text: '<p>Welcome to ZenMEM, the Center for Music, Edition, Media. The ZenMEM emerged from a <a href="https://project.zenmem.de/">project</a> funded by the BMBF and conducts the activities of the University of Paderborn in the field of Digital Music Edition and Digital Musicology. Doing so, it is also the successor of the <a href="https://edirom.de/edirom-projekt/">Edirom project</a>, which has laid the foundations for a genuinely digital music philology in Germany and beyond. At the same time, it is the organisational home of the <a href="/vife">ViFE</a>. The <em>Virtual Research Group Edirom</em> is an association of scholars who work or have worked in one of the digital Paderborn/Detmold <a href="/projects">projects</a> and are dedicated to the conceptual and technical further development of digital musicology.</p>',

    education_text: '<p>Since 2010, the employees of the Virtual Research Group Edirom (ViFE) have been organizing an annual <a href="https://ess.uni-paderborn.de/" target="_blank">Edirom Summer School</a> on their own responsibility: Here they offer workshops on topics related to digital (music) edition. Again and again, they are supported by specialists from Germany and abroad. They also provide insights into the latest research projects and results. The focus will be on coding with MEI (the only service in Germany) and TEI, as well as tools related to the Edirom. In addition there are offers for the handling of XML data, for version management and databases etc.</p><p>At the same time, the ESS has developed into an exchange platform for researchers, users and interested parties. In addition to the numerous opportunities for discussion, participants can also present and discuss their questions and projects with the help of posters or their own workshops within the framework of so-called "spotlights".</p><p>In addition, the employees are frequently invited to workshops and consultations at other universities or on individual projects and they regularly offer lectures at the University of Paderborn.</p>',

    vife_text: '<p>The <a href="https://edirom.de" title="Virtual Research Group Edirom (ViFE)" target="_blank">Virtual Research Group Edirom (ViFE)</a> is an association of current and former employees of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.muwi-detmold-paderborn.de" title="Musicology Department Detmold/Paderborn">Musicology Department Detmold/Paderborn</a> who are involved in various projects dealing with the application of digital methods in musicology. The common goal is the promotion of digital work in the field of musicological research, especially of digital text and music editions.</p><p>The group is named after the DFG project for the development of tools for digital historio-critical music editions (2006-2012), which became known under the name "Edirom" and formed the starting point for a number of other digital projects.</p><p>The work of the group, which is both nationally and internationally oriented, focuses on the conception of digital editions and their forms of publication, the application and further development of relevant standards (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">TEI</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://music-encoding.org">MEI</a>) and tools, questions of data modelling and project organization, the promotion of communication between digitally working projects and institutions, and the teaching of corresponding knowledge and skills. The partners in the network are working together to develop competencies in these areas in order to be available as contact persons for the new digital community.</p><p>In order to promote young researchers, ViFE supports exam papers and dissertations in the context of the projects.</p>',

    projects_text: '<p>All projects realized by ZenMEM and ViFE in Detmold/Paderborn in the context of Digital Humanities are related to (at least) one of the core topics of ZenMEM: digital (music) editions in the broadest sense, the encoding standards of MEI and TEI or research data management around music notation, metadata, image, audio and video data and texts with a musical reference. ZenMEM and ViFE foster the coordinated further development of encoding standards, the methodological and theoretical further development of digital editions and the coordination and standardization of research data management in cooperation with memory institutions through a close exchange of projects.</p><p>Projects based in Detmold/Paderborn are understood as ZenMEM projects, projects in which ZenMEM and ViFE are involved, but which are based in another institution, are understood as <a href="#coop_projects">cooperation</a> projects.</p>',

    coop_projects_text: 'Project cooperation includes all projects and project consortia that do not have their main parts in Detmold/Paderborn, but in which ZenMEM and ViFE are involved via research associates or research by contract.',

    cooperation_text: '<p>ZenMEM and ViFE cooperate on the one hand very directly in <a href="/projects#coop_projects">project cooperations</a> with different institutions and persons, on the other hand very closely outside or rather beyond the borders of project contexts with centres, institutions and persons.</p><p>If you would like to cooperate with ZenMEM and ViFE, please <a href="/contact">contact us</a>. We look forward to hearing from you.</p>',

    standards_text: '<p>The Digital Humanities seek to answer scholarly research questions using digital methods. For this purpose, the various objects of research - texts, letters, music, audio/video recordings, illustrations, etc. - must be transformed into dgital representations. In recent decades, relevant data standards have been established for the various object types, above all <strong><a href="https://tei-c.org" target="_blank">TEI</a></strong> for text coding and <strong><a href="https://music-encoding.org" target="_blank">MEI</a></strong> for music documents. Data standards such as TEI and MEI form the science-driven backbone of Digital Humanities, ensuring the integrability and re-usability of research results. Data standards are thus also the basis for the idea of a <em><a href="http://nfdi.de" target="_blank">National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI)</a></em>.</p><p>The preparation of the object of research is called (data) modelling; it requires many years of experience in the digital domain as well as a good understanding of the content issue. For many years <em>ZenMEM</em> has been involved in the development of both TEI and MEI as well as in the <a href="/education">teaching</a> of their use. Representatives of ZenMEM are elected members of the <a href="https://tei-c.org/activities/council/" target="_blank">TEI Technical Council</a> and the <a href="https://music-encoding.org/community/mei-board.html" target="_blank">MEI Board</a>. From the very beginning ZenMEM has been striving to build up a MEI community and is still one of the leading international centers in the field of music coding.</p>',

    tools_text: '<p>Research in the Digital Humanities is based on the processing, evaluation and presentation of research data. Although different research questions lead to different demands on the technical implementation, there are frequently recurring questions that can be answered by generic tools. <em>ZenMEM</em> has developed or contributed to the development of some of these tools in various projects. On this page we present some of these tools.</p>',
