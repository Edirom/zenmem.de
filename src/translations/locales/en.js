    home_text: '<p>Welcome to ZenMEM, the Center for Music, Edition, Media. The ZenMEM emerged from a <a href="https://project.zenmem.de/">project</a> funded by the BMBF and conducts the activities of the University of Paderborn in the field of Digital Music Edition and Digital Musicology. Doing so, it is also the successor of the <a href="https://edirom.de/edirom-projekt/">Edirom project</a>, which has laid the foundations for a genuinely digital music philology in Germany and beyond. At the same time, it is the organisational home of the <a href="https://dev.zenmem.de/ViFE_abbr">ViFE</a>. The <em>Virtual Research Group Edirom</em> is an association of scholars who work or have worked in one of the digital Paderborn/Detmold <a href="https://dev.zenmem.de/projects">projects</a> and are dedicated to the conceptual and technical further development of digital musicology.</p>',

    education_text: '<p>Since 2010, the employees of the Virtual Research Group Edirom (ViFE) have been organizing an annual <a href="https://ess.uni-paderborn.de/" target="_blank">Edirom Summer School</a> on their own responsibility: Here they offer workshops on topics related to digital (music) edition. Again and again, they are supported by specialists from Germany and abroad. They also provide insights into the latest research projects and results. The focus will be on coding with MEI (the only service in Germany) and TEI, as well as tools related to the Edirom. In addition there are offers for the handling of XML data, for version management and databases etc.</p><p>At the same time, the ESS has developed into an exchange platform for researchers, users and interested parties. In addition to the numerous opportunities for discussion, participants can also present and discuss their questions and projects with the help of posters or their own workshops within the framework of so-called "spotlights".</p><p>In addition, the employees are frequently invited to workshops and consultations at other universities or on individual projects and they regularly offer lectures at the University of Paderborn.</p>',
